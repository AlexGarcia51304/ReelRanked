# ReelRanker Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders of the **ReelRanker** community pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, inclusive, respectful, and creative community centered on media discovery and collaboration.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy, kindness, and respect toward others  
* Being open to differing opinions and creative viewpoints  
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback  
* Taking responsibility for mistakes and learning from them  
* Focusing on what improves the experience for the ReelRanker community as a whole  

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Use of sexualized language or imagery, or any kind of unwelcome attention  
* Trolling, insulting, or harassing comments about others’ opinions or preferences  
* Public or private harassment or intimidation

* Any behavior that disrupts collaboration or makes others feel unsafe or unwelcome  

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of behavior. They will take appropriate and fair action in response to any behavior deemed harmful, threatening, or inconsistent with this Code.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove or reject comments, commits, code, media reviews, or other contributions that violate this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.
