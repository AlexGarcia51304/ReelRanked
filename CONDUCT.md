# ReelRanker Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders of the **ReelRanker** 305Soft team pledge to make participation in our project and meetings a positive, harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to maintaining an open, inclusive, respectful, and professional environment for all team members and contributors.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy, kindness, and respect toward others  
* Being open to differing opinions and constructive discussion  
* Taking responsibility for mistakes and learning from them  
* Focusing on what improves the project and team experience for everyone  

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Use of sexualized language or imagery, or any kind of unwanted attention  
* Trolling, insults, or personal attacks  
* Public or private harassment or intimidation  
* Posting private or personal information without explicit consent  
* Behavior that disrupts collaboration or makes others feel unsafe or unwelcome

## Scope

This Code applies within all **ReelRanker** project spaces—repositories, team meetings, documentation, communication channels—and when members represent the team in public.

## 305Soft Team Policies and Expectations

### No Distracted Technology Use
During all team meetings, phones and unrelated devices must remain away unless explicitly required for the project. Focused participation ensures respect and productivity.

### Decisions
Decisions will be made by **majority vote** after open discussion. For critical design or project direction choices, **consensus** is preferred.

### Attendance
Members are expected to attend all scheduled meetings, whether in person or online. Legitimate reasons for missing include illness, emergencies, or academic conflicts—notify the team in advance and review notes afterward to stay updated.

### Assignments
Tasks will be assigned based on skill and interest, agreed upon by the team. Members who fail to complete tasks on time must communicate promptly and coordinate catch-up work. Repeated missed or poor work will trigger a team discussion and redistribution of responsibilities.

### Participation
Communication will occur primarily through the project’s group chat and shared documents. Each member is encouraged to contribute ideas, feedback, and updates. We will ensure full participation by recognizing individual strengths and assigning roles that align with those strengths.

### Meeting Times and Locations / Mediums
Meeting times will be set by consensus to fit everyone’s schedule. Most meetings will occur either in person on campus or via video conferencing tools (e.g., Microsoft Teams or Zoom).

### Agenda and Minutes / Notes
A rotating member will take meeting notes each session. Notes and agendas will be stored in the shared project folder (e.g., Google Drive or GitHub Wiki) for easy access.

### Promptness
Members are expected to arrive on time for all meetings. If running late, notify the group as soon as possible. Chronic lateness will be addressed in a private check-in.

### Conversational Courtesies
We will practice active listening, share airtime equally, and stay on topic. Respectful dialogue is expected—interruptions, side conversations, and tangents will be minimized to maintain focus.

### Enforcement / Feedback
If someone violates these guidelines, the team will first issue a friendly reminder or private check-in. Repeated issues will result in a group discussion or escalation to the instructor. Feedback will be given constructively and respectfully, using “I” statements and focusing on behavior, not personality.
