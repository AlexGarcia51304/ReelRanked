## Observation 1:
**Observation Statement:**
Most of the users are between the ages of 16-29, which means our target consumers are on the younger side. With this it will likely be easier
for them to make navigate and use the app

**Supporting Data:**
- 55.6% fall into the range of 16–22 years old & 33.3% fall into the range of 23–29 years old  
- 59.3% identified as College Students

**Team Action (if any):**
- Make a U/I design that would further influence and attract younger people like a "social-media-like" app

Observation 4:
  Observation: Users don't care as much about AI implementation as expected
  Source: 44% of users said they were only "somewhat interested" in AI implementation in the app
  Team action: Don't go overboard on AI implementation, possibly add a feature that disables AI for users who don't want it
