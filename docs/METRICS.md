- Adoption Rate/Number of new users - Firebase analytics will show a graph that depicts the number of new users to an app. It can display results based on things like app version or platform and it can be viewed in timespans of day, week, and month.


- Retention Rate (Number of returning users) -- User Retention
  - Retention measures the number of users who return to the app within a specified period. It reflects how well ReelRanker keeps existing users entertained and engaged.
  - Currently, all of the users who entered the app have not returned. Day 0 shows 100% of users were on the app, meaning that all of us developing the app had entered. The following       days show 0% retention rate. This means that none of the users who made an account have come back. Once the app is completed and if it is being used by the public, the retention        rate should be higher than 0%, and using it can determine if people like using the app, and maybe how we can improve that. To improve retention once the app is launched, we can add     features such as customizable tabs where users can track and manage their recently watched titles, favorites, and to-watch lists.
